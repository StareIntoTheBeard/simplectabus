== Simple CTA Bus Tracker
This is a simple bus tracker you can add bus routes and stop ids through the GUI.
Stop IDs are gleaned from the getStops api at the moment. Javascript refreshes the browser every minute.
Run `rake db:seed` to create a blank API Key setting and you'll need your own Bus Tracker API Key to use this which you set at '/settings'.  If you wanna modify this to do something sexier like use better environment variables or yaml, be my guest.

That's about it.
